# The Role of Algorithms in Computing

---

## What is Algorithm?

An algorithm is a finite, well-defined sequence of computational steps that transforms input into output.

- Correctness : Prodeces the right output for all valid inputs.
- Finiteness : Must eventually stop.
- Effectiveness : Each step is doable.
- Input/Output.

## Algorithm as a Technology

Algorithms matter even if hardware has improved. 

- Performance bottlenecks cannot be solved by hardware alone.
- Large input size.
- Efficiency determines feasibility.
