## 2.3 - Operands of Computer Hardware

> This section explains how RISC-V accesses data.

### Three Sources of Operands in RISC-V

- Register -> Fastest place to store/operate on data.
- Memory -> For large data (arrays, structs, heap, stack).
- Immediates -> Constants encoded directly inside instructions.

### Memory Access

RISC-V uses base register + 12-bit signed immediate for memory addressing.

``` asm
lw x5, 8(x6)    ; load word from Memory[x6 + 8] into x5
sw x5, -4(x2)   ; store x5 to Memory[x2 - 4]
```

### Arrays and Pointers

Assume the variable ```g``` is assigned to ```x5```, ```p``` -> ```x11```, and the array ```A``` has base address in ```x10```.

``` C
g = A[3];
g = *p;
```

``` asm
lw x5, 12(x10)    ; one word is four byte, so the third item is located at x10 + 12 bytes
lw x5, 0(x11)
```
