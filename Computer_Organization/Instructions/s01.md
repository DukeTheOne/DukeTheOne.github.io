# Instructions : Language of the Computer

---

## 2.1 - Introduction

> This chapter explains the basic ideas behind assembly language, instruction sets, and how hardware executes them.

### RISC-V Design Philosophy

- Simple, regular ISA.
- Fixed 32-bit instruction format.
- Load/store architecture.
- 32 registers (x0~x31).
- Emphasis on pipelining.
- Open and modular.

### Stored-Program Concept

Instructions and data are both stored in memory. Program execution loop : 

1. **Fetch** instruction from memory.
2. **Decode** it.
3. **Execute** via ALU/registers.
4. Possibly access **memory**.
5. **Write back** results.

### Three Main Classes of Instructions.

Arithmetic/logical operations -> Operate on registers only.

- ```add```, ```sub```, ```and```, shifts, compares.

Memory access -> Only load and store instructions access memory.

- ```lw``` load word, ```sw``` store word.

Control flow -> Change PC

- Conditional branches ```beq```, ```bne```.
- Unconditional jumps ```jal```, ```jalr```.

### Key Registers

- x0 : constant zero
- x1 (ra) : return address
- x2 (sp) : stack pointer
- x5–x7 : general temporaries
- x10–x17 (a0–a7) : argument registers
- x8–x9, x18–x27 : saved registers (s registers)
