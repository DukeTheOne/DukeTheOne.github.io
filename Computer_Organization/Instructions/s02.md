## 2.2 - Operations of Computer Hardware

> RISC-V is a load/store architecture, which means ALU operations only operate on register, and only load and store instructions access memory.

### Arithmetic Instructions (R-type)

Register type instructions do not access data memory.

``` asm
add rd, rs1, rs2     ; rd = rs1 + rs2
sub rd, rs1, rs2     ; rd = rs1 - rs2
sll rd, rs1, rs2     ; logical left shift
slt rd, rs1, rs2     ; set rd = 1 if rs1 < rs2 else 0
xor rd, rs1, rs2
or  rd, rs1, rs2
and rd, rs1, rs2
```

### Immediate Instructions (I-type)

Immediates are sign-extended. We hardcode numbers to avoid memory access.

``` asm
addi  rd, rs1, 10     ; rd = rs1 + 10
slti  rd, rs1, 2
andi  rd, rs1, 0xEE
ori   rd, rs1, 0xFF
xori  rd, rs1, 0x7F
```

### C to RISC-V

``` C
f = (g + h) - (i + j);
```
Assume the variable f is assigned to x5, g -> x6, h-> x7, i -> x20, j -> x21.

``` asm
add x1, x6, x7     ; x1 = g + h
add x2, x20, x21   ; x2 = i + j
sub x5, x1, x2     ; f = x1 - x2
```

Note that we need to load the value into registers before doing operations under RISC-V ISA.
