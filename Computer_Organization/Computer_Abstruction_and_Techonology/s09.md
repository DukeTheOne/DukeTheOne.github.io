## 1.3 - Benchmark

> Benchmarks are programs or workloads used to measure and compare computer performance.

### Why are Benchmarks needed?

A benchmark is a program or set of programs used to measure computer performance, 
compare different systems, evaluate architectural improvements, test compilers or runtime systems.

Benchmarks must reflect real-world usage, and only running actual programs shows the meaningful performance other than IC, CPI, clock rate.

### Types of Benchmarks

- Synthetic benchmarks : Not real programs, artificial workloads, easy to run but often misleading.
- Microbenchmarks/Kernels : Small peices of code focusing one one behavior, like matrix multiplication, memory copy, sorting.
- Real applications : Actual workloads like database, ML, compiler, web server. Hard to run and standardize.
- Benchmark Suites : A collection of standardized workloads. SPEC is the most widely used benchmark suite in computer architecture. 

### Benchmark Requirements

- Representative : Reflect real usage patterns.
- Portable : Runs on many systems.
- Repeatable : Produces consistent results.
- Scalable : Applicable to different generations of hardware.

### Extra Points

#### Any program can be a benchmark?

> No. A benchmark must be representative and standardized.
