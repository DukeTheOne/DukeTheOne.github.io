# Computer Abstruction and Techonology

---

## 1.8 - From Uniprocessor to Multiprocessor

> The entire computer industry shifted form single, fast CPU to multicore processor.

### Why the industry shifted?

- End of frequency scaling -> This is the major reason due to power and heat limits.
- ILP -> Techniques like branch prediction, out-of-order execution, superscalar pipeline had already extracted most parallelism. Making cores wider or deeper gave minimal benefit.
- Parallel workloads increasing -> Applications that benefit from parallelism, such as graphcs, multimedia, AI, cloud service.

### Implications for Programmer

- Software -> Parallel algorithms, synchronization, task partitioning, race condition.
- Tools & languaues -> OpenMP, CUDA, pthreads, parallel libraries, task scheduler.
- Architect -> Shared-cache, coherence protocols, interconnects, scalable memory system.

### Extra Points

#### Double the cores != double the performance

> By Amdahl's law, performance does not scale linearly.
