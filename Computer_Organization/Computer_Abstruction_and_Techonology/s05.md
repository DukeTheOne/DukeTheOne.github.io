## 1.5 - Techonologies for Building Processors and Memory

> This section explains how hardware is physically built, from transistors to chips.

### CMOS Technology

Modern processors, memory, and digital circuits are built using CMOS technology. 
Because CMOS is very low static power, high density, reliable and scalable.

### IC Manufacturing and Fabrication

Chips are made on silicon wafers. The manufacturing involves lithography, deposition, etching, doping.

- Yield : Percentage of working chips per wafer.

### SRAM vs DRAM

- **SRAM** -> Used for caches, veryfast, more transistors per bit, lower density.
- **DRAM** -> Used for main memory, slower, higher density, needs refresh cycles (capcacitor leak).

### Flash & SSD

- Flash memory -> Non-volatile, used in SSD, USB, slower writes, faster reads, block erase operations.
- SSD -> faster than HDD, lower latency, no moving parts.
- HDD -> relies on spinning disks, thus slower.

### Extra Points

#### CPU gets faster by increasing GHz

> This is true, but be aware that this improvement has reached the bottleneck due to power limits.
> Modern CPU uses parallelism to further improve performance.
