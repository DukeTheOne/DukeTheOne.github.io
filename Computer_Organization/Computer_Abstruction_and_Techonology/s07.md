## 1.7 - Power Wall

> The power wall refers to the practical limit on power consumption and heat dissipation that prevents CPUs from increasing clock frequency.

### CPU Power Formula

- C : Capacitance (transistor size).
- V : voltage.
- f : clock frequency.

``` math
Power \propto C * V^2 * f
```

### End of Dennard Scaling

Before 2005, we kept shrinking the transistor size. But to a extend, the voltage, current, power connot stay constant per chip area. 
And because of that power wall, we cannot increase the clock speed.

> Instead, we started to work on parallelism. Adding more cores to increase throughput.

### Energy Efficiency

Architects now focus on the lower-power design with efficient microarchitectures and lower-voltage operation. 
And some specialized accelerators like GPU, TPU are important for modern computing.

### Extra Points

#### Is it Moore's law ended so performance slowed?

> No. Moore's law refers to transistor count. Power wall is the real problem.

#### More cores != more speed

> This is limited by parallelism (Amdahl's law) and dark silicon. Dark silicon means because of **heat**, we cannot power all transistors simultaneously.
