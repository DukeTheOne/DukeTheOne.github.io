## 1.4 - Under the Covers

> Every computer system contains five major components: input, output, memory, datapath, control.

### Datapath

The datapath contains ALU, registers, buses, multiplexers, program counter (PC). 
Datapath handles the **data-flow**, including arithmetic/logic operations, address calculation, instruction execution steps.

### Control

The control unit is the brain of CPU. It tells the datapath what to do with the control signals. Control signals change every instruction.

- Which register to read.
- Which ALU operation to use.
- Whether to read/write memory.
- How to update PC.

### Memory

- Address : Each memory location has an address. RISC-V uses byte addressing, meaning computer can access or modify single bytes of data.
- **Address Space** : Range of addresses the program can access. 

### Program Execution Cycle

1. Fetch instruction from memory.
2. Decode instruction.
3. Execute with ALU.
4. Access memory if needed.
5. Write back results.
6. Update PC.

### Extra Points

#### PC

> Program Counter is a special register in a CPU that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed.
