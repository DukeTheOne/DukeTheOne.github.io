# Computer Abstruction and Techonology

---

## Summary

1. Computer architecture is built on abstraction.
2. RISC-V is a simple load/store ISA.
3. 7 ideas: abstraction, common case fast, parallelism, pipelining, prediction, memory hierarchy, redundancy.
4. Program translation: HLL → compiler → assembler → linker → loader → machine code.
5. CPU = datapath + control.
6. Execution cycle: IF–ID–EX–MEM–WB.
7. Technology: CMOS, SRAM vs DRAM, Moore’s Law, end of Dennard scaling.
8. Performance equation : CPU Time = IC × CPI × Cycle Time. Performance = 1/Time.
9. Amdahl’s Law limits speedup.
10. Power Wall: V can’t scale → power density → clock rates flat → multicore.
11. Sea Change: multicore replaces uniprocessors; scaling limited by parallelism.
12. Clusters: real parallel limits (communication overhead).
13. Benchmarks: measure execution time; SPEC widely used; avoid MIPS.
