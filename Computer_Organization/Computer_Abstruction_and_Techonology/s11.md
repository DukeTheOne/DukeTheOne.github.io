## 1.11 - Fallacies and Pitfalls

> Fallacy, a mistaken belief (misconception); Pitfall, a common mistake in practice.

### Fallacy 1 - Higher clock rate means higher performance

This is false because performance also depends on IC, CPI, architecture efficiency, memory hierarchy.
We use CPU performance equation to measure, not just clock rate.

### Fallacy 2 - One number can summarize performance

There is no single metric captures all aspects.

- Latency.
- Throughput.
- Memory behavior.
- Branch behavior
- Workload diversity.

### Fallacy 3 - More hardware features always improve performance

By Amdahl's law, we know this is not true.

- More instructions (SISC) isn't faster.
- More core but if software isn't parallel.
- Larger caches but the latency trade-off.

### Pitfall 1 - Using MIPS as a performance metric

MIPS is misleading because different ISA has different IC, so high MIPS doesn't mean high performance. 
The correct metric is execution time.

### Pitfall 2 - Overlooking the impact of memory

CPU performance often limited by cache miss, memory latency, bandwidth.

### Pitfall 3 - Thinking peak performance is sustained performance

The actual performance can be far lower. The real workloads involve stalls, branching, memory access, OS interrupts.
