# Computer Abstruction and Techonology

## 1.3 - Below Your Program

> This section explains how high-level programs become machine instructions, and how computers execute them.

### High to Low Level

> HLL -> Compiler -> Assembler -> Linker -> Loader -> Execution.

- High-level language (HLL) : Human-readable code.
- Compiler : Translate HLL to optimized assembly code.
- Assembler : Translate assembly to machine code (binary instructions).
- Linker : Combine modules and libraries into the final executable program.
- Loader : Load programs into memory for execution.

### ISA

ISA defines the instructions (add, load, store, branch...), registers, instruction formats, data types.
RISC-V has a load/store architecture, 32 registers, and fixed-length 32-bit instructions.

### Types of Computer Instructions

- Arithmetic/Logical -> Operate on register values.
- Memory Access -> Load from memory to register, or store from register to memory.
- Control Flow -> Conditional branches, jump and return.

### Compilation Example (C -> RISC-V)

``` C
// C code
f = g + h;
```
compiled into
``` asm
; asm
add x5, x6, x7
```

### Extra Points

#### ISA != implementation

> ISA is just specifying the formats of the instruction set, and how the software interacts with hardware,
> the hardware implementation may differ.
