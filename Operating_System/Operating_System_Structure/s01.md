# Operating System Structure

---

## 2.1 - Operating System Services

> OS provides services to users and programs. OS makes computing easier, safer, and more efficient. 

### System Calls

Every services mentioned later is accessed through **system calls**. 
System calls are the interface to OS services for user programs.

### Program Execution

- Load program into memory.
- Execute program.
- Provide runtime environment.
- Terminate execution properly.

### I/O Operations

OS provides uniform interface for I/O devices like keyboard, disk, printer, network card.

### File-System Manipulation

- File creation, deletion, reading, writing.
- Directory navigation.
- Permissions.
- File metadata (size, timestamps).

### Communication between Processes

- Message Passing.
- Shared Memory.

### Error Detection

- Memory errors.
- Overflow.
- Device failures.
- Network issues.
- Illegal operations.

### Resource Allocation

- CPU time (scheduling).
- Memory.
- Disk space.
- I/O devices.

### Logging/Accounting

- CPU usage.
- Memory usage.
- Disk space.
- Network bandwidth.

### Protection and Security

- Proper access control.
- Authentication.
- Isolation of processes.
- Protection of kernel from user programs.
- Secure user data.

### Extra Points

#### User services vs System services

> User services are those convenient features for running programs. System services maintain and manage the OS/hardware.

#### Protection vs Security

> Protection is controlling access between processes. Secutity is defending from external threats.
