# Operating System Structure

## 2.2 - User and Operating System Interface

> OS provides several interfaces so that users, developers, and programs can interact with the system.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

A CLI uses text commands. User enters commands at a prompt. For example, Unix shells (bash, sh), Windows PowerShell.

- Pros : Very flexible, automatable via scripts, low overhead.
- Cons : Requires more exertise, less user-friendly.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

GUI uses windows, icons, menus, pointers (WIMP model). For example, Windows desktop, Gnome, KDE. 
Touch-screen Interface is a modern variant of GUI.

- Pros : Easy to learn, attractive, intuitive, suitable for most users.
- Cons : Higher resource usage, less scriptable, hiding some system detials.

### System calls and APIs

System calls are low-level functions provided by OS. 
System call provides entry into kernel mode, and accessed through a trap or software interrupt.

APIs are higher-level libraries that wrap system calls. 
Applications usually call APIs, not system calls directly.

### Command Interpreter / Shell

A shell is a program that reads user commands, parses them, then executes system calls or programs. 
Shells are **not** part of the kernel, but part of the system program layer.

### Modes of system service execution

- Direct system call : Program requests OS service via trap.
- Shell invocation : User enters command -> shell interprets -> executes program.
- GUI invocation : User clicks icon -> GUI launches program -> eventual system calls underneath.

### Extra Points

#### Shell != Terminal

> Shell is the command interpreter, and terminal is just an application showing the shell.

#### GUI is not part of the kernel

> GUI runs in the user space.
