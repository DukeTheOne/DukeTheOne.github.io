# Operating System Structure

---

## 2.6 - Why Applications are OS Specific?

> Applications are usually tied to a specific OS because dependences.

### System Calls 

System calls are the funcamental API the OS exposes. Each OS has diffenent-

- System call names.
- Parameters.
- Behaviors.
- Numbering conventions.
- Calling conventions.

Even if two OSes support "open a file", the system call interface is NOT the same.

### OS-Specific ABIs

**Application Binary Interface (ABI)** defines the usage or layout of system calls, registers, stack, executables... 
Different OSes use different ABIs. For example, executable compiled for Linux cannot run on Windows.

### Different Library Ecosystem

Applications rely heavily on OS libraries, thus switching OS means different libraries. 
We cannot simply replace them without rewriting or recompiling the program.

### File System

Apps expect different directory structures, path formats, permission models. 
For example ```C:\ProgramFiles\App``` vs ```/usr/bin/app```.

### I/O and Device Interface

Apps rely on Win32 device drivers, /dev device files or IOKit. Device access is NOT protable.

### Process Model Differences

For example, Linux uses ```fork()```, Windows does not; Windows uses handles, Linux uses file descriptors.
So apps expecting these models are not portable.

### Security Models

OSes have different permission rules, user accounts, sandboxing, access control mechanisms.

### GUI/Framework

Applications may depend on a specific framework or interface tool that is only available on certain OS.

### Extra Points

#### API vs ABI

> API is source code level, and ABI is binary level.
