## 2.4 - System Services (System Programs)

> System programs are utilities and programs above the OS kernel, and providing useful functionality.

### What is System Program

System programs are user-level programs that provide a user interface to manage files, support programming tools, help run and maintain the system. 
These Programs access OS functionality through system calls if needed.

Systme programs provide developer tools, support automation via scripts, and provide the default user environment. 
Without them, the OS kernel would be practically unusable.

### Types of System Programs

- File management. ```cp, mv, rm, mkdir```...
- Status Information. ```ps, top, df, uptime```...
- File modification. ```vi, nano, awk```...
- Programming languate support. ```gcc, gdb, javac, python```...
- Program loading and execution. ```ld, bash, zsh```...
- Comunications. ```ssh, ftp```...
- System utilities. For example, backup programs, package managers...

### Extra Points

#### Shell is a system program

> Shell is a user interface that acts as a bridge between the user and the OS kernel, allowing users to execute commands and access system services.

#### System program != System call

> System program runs in user mode, and it might invoke system calls to request OS services.
