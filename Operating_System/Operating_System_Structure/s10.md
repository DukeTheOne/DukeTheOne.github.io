## 2.10 - Operating System Debugging

> Debugging in OS is more complex than debugging a normal user program.
> Because kernel runs in privileged mode and we cannot easily attach a debugger.

### What is OS Debugging?

OS debugging is the techniques for finding..

- Kernel bugs.
- Driver problems.
- Memory corruption.
- Deadlocks or race conditions.
- Crashes.

### Debugging Tools and Methods

- Logging (trace message) : Logging helps detect patterns and diagnose intermittent issues.
- Core/crash dumps : When a process or kernel crashes, OS stores a **snapshot of memory** at the moment of crash.
- Performance monitoring tools : Monitoring CPU, disk I/O, network...
- Kernel debuggers : Kernel debuggers allow stepping through kernel code, inspecting kernel memory.
- Tracing : Recording detailed sequences of events without stopping the system.
- Profiling : Analyzing where time is spent during execution.
- Deadlock detection tools : Resource-allocation graph, driver verification tools, thread state analysis.
- System boot and shutdown logs : Helps diagnose issues with damaged drivers, missing modules.

### Debugging Approaches

- Print debugging -> Useful during early development.
- Remote debugging -> Debugging kernel on another machine, so we can stop the running OS.
- Postmortem debugging -> Analyzing crash dumps after reboot. Used heavily.

### Extra Points

#### Logging != Tracing

> Logging keeps high-level messages. Tracing logs fine-grained sequence of low-level events.

#### Profiling != Performance monitoring

> Profiling tracks where time is spent inside code. Monitoring tracks high-level CPU/memory/disk use.
