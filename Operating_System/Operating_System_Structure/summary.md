# Operating System Structure

---

## Summary

1. System calls are the interface between user programs and kernel.
2. Trap -> kernel mode -> system-call handler -> return.
3. API -> high-level; System call -> kernel entry point.
4. Kernel architectures : monolithic, layered, microkernel, modular, hybrid.
5. Linker -> build time; loader -> run time.
6. Boot sequence : Firmware -> bootloader -> kernel -> initialized -> services.
7. Apps are OS-specific due to different system calls, ABI, libraries...
8. Debugging tools : Logging, tracing, crash dumps, profiling, kernel debugger...
