## 2.8 - Operating System Structure

> OS structure describes how components are arranged and interact.

### Monolithic Structure

The early UNIX puts entire OS in one big program. There is no clear separation between modules, no protection between components.

### Layered Approach

OS is divided into layers, each built on top of lower layers. For example,

1. User interface.
2. File system.
3. Device drivers.
4. CPU scheduling, memory management.
5. Hardware.

- Pros : Simple, clean design, easier debugging, security.
- Cons : Hard to define boundaries, poor performance due to layer overhead.

### Microkernel Approach

Making kernel as small as possible. Kernel contains IPC, basic scheduling, basic memory management. 
And everything else (file system, drivers, networking...) runs in user space. 

- Pros : High reliability, crash isolation, easier to extend, better security.
- Cons : Slower due to message passing, context switching overhead.

### Modular Kernel Approach

Most modern kernels use loadable kernel modules. 

- Pros : Flexible, good performance, easier update.
- Cons : Bugs in modules can still crash entire kernel, still large kernel. 

### Hybrid Kernel

Combine elements of monolithic and microkernel designs. 
This gives good performance and more modularity, flexibility than monolithic or pure microkernel. 

### Virtual Machine Structure

VM provide an additional OS structure layer. They act like mini OS managing resources, adding a new layer of abstraction.

### System Boot Structure

Boot sequence is also part of OS structure.

- Firmware (BIOS/UEFI) initializes hardware.
- Bootloader loads kernel.
- Kernel loads modules.
- Kernel initializes subsystems.
- First user process starts (```systemd```).

### Extra Points

#### Microkernel != Modular

> Microkernel is minimal. Modular means loadable modules in a monolithic kernel.
