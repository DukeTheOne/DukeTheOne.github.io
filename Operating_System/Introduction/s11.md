## 1.11 - Free and Open-Source OS

> This section explains the distinction between free, open-source, and why open-source OS matters today.

### What is Open-Source OS?

An open-source OS is one where the source code is publicly available, 
and users are free to view/modify the source code, distribute their modifications, or redistribute the OS.

### Free vs Open-Source

Free software refers to **freedom** to run/study/modify/distribute, not about price.
Most modern OSes combine both free and open-source.

### Benefits of Open-Source OS Development

- Development transparency.
- Community collaboration.
- Security.
- Portability.
- Customizability.

### Popular Open-Source OS

- Linux -> Used in PC, servers, supercomputers, embedded devices.
- BSD family -> Stable network stack. FreeBSD for performance, OpenBSD for security, NetBSD for portability.
- Android (AOSP) -> Based on Linux kernel. Most common OS in the world.

### Licensing Models

- Copyleft licenses (GPL) : If you distribute modified code, then you must release source code. This ensures software remains free/open.
- Permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache) : Allowing proprietary reuse, and not required to release your modified source.

### Extra Points

#### Android is not fully open source

> AOSP is open, but Google apps/services are proprietary.
