## 3.8 - Communication in Client-Server Systems

> Client–server communication is fundamental to modern operating systems and networked applications. 

### Client-Server Model Overview

- Client -> Requests service, initiates communication.
- Server -> Provides service, waits for requests.

Clients and servers can be on the same machine (local IPC) or across multiple machines (network IPC).

### Local Communication Methods

- Shared memory -> Fastest, needs synchronization.
- Pipe/named pipe.
- UNIX domain socket -> Same API as TCP socket, but without networking stack.
- Message queue/mailbox -> Persistent channel.

### Network Communication Methods

Stream socket (TCP) and Datagram socket (UDP) are used. 
Even web and HTTP-based communication.
1. Server creates socket.
2. Server binds to port.
3. Server listens to the port.
4. Client connects to port.
5. Both side send/receive.

### Extra Points

#### RPC != Message passing directly

> RPC uses message passing but hides it behind function calls.
