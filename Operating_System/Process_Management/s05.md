## 3.5 - IPC in Shared-Memory System

> Shared-memory IPC allows two or more processes to exchange data by directly reading/writing a region of memory. 

### What is Shared Memory?

Shared memory is created by OS, and mapped into multiple processes' virtual address spaces.
It appears at different virtual addresses, but points to the same physical memory.

- Pros : Fastest IPC for large data sets, no kernel involvement, use regular memory instructions.
- Cons : OS does not enforce consistency, developers must handle race conditions.

### Synchronization is Required

Shared memory has no inherent protection against race conditions. 
If two processes access shared memory concurrently, there might occur inconsistent read, lost update, corrupt data, or even deadlock.

Thus, shared memory almost always involves synchronization tools. Like semaphore, mutex, monitor.

### Producer-Consumer

This is a classic example of shared-memory IPC, and we need synchronization to solve the race condition.

- Producer processes write data into shared buffer.
- Consumer processes read data from shared buffer.

### Extra Points

#### Pipe is NOT shared memory

> Pipes use kernel buffers. Shared memory means user-space mappings.
