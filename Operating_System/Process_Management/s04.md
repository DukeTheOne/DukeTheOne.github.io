## 3.4 - Interprocess Communication (IPC)

> IPC is the way for processes to exchange data and synchronize their actions.

### Shared Memory Model

1. OS establishes shared memory segment.
2. Processes attach the segment.
3. They read/write that region directly.

- Pros : Fastest, no kernel overhead, great for large data transfers.
- Cons : Requires **synchronization** (chapter 6).

### Message Passing Model

- Direct communication -> Processes communicate using **names** of each other.

``` C
send(P1, msg);
receive(P2, msg);
```

- Indirect communication -> Processes communicate through **mailboxes** or **ports**.

``` C
send(mailbox, msg);
receive(mailbox, msg);
```

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication

- Synchronous (Blocking) : Sender/receiver waits until message is received/arrived.
- Asynchronous : Sender does not wait. Receiver may get NULL if no messages. 

> Blocking send + blocking receive = tightly synchronized processes.

### Buffering

- Zero-capacity buffer (no queue) -> Sender must block until receiver is ready.
- Bounded buffer -> Sender blocks if buffer is full. Receiver blocks if empty.
- Unbounded buffer (infinite queue) -> Sender never blocks. Receiver blocks when empty.

### Signals

Asynchronous notifications sent to a process. For example, ```SIGINT```(ctrl+C), ```SIGKILL```.

> Signals are **NOT** for transferring data, but notify events.

### Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)

> Client calls a function as if it were local, but actually OS/network delivers the request to a server.

RPC handles marshaling/unmarshaling (convert data), network transmission, server execution, return values.

### UNIX IPC Mechanisms

- Pipe -> Unidirectional communication between related processes. For example ```ls | grep txt```.
- Named pipe (FIFO) -> Like pipe but work between unrelated processes.
- Message queue -> kernel-managed mailboxes.
- Shared memory segment -> fast but requires semaphores or locks.
- Socket -> Used for networked IPC or local UNIX domain socket.

### Extra Points

#### Pipes are NOT bidirectional

> Anonymous pipes are one-way. Named pipes can be two-way.

#### Message passing is NOT slow

> Modern kernels optimize message passing heavily.
