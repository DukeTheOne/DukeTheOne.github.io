## 3.2 - Process Scheduling

> Process scheduling is how the OS decides which process should run next on the CPU.This is m anaged by the scheduler and dispatcher.

### Scheduling Queues

- Ready queue -> Holds processes **ready** to run but waiting for CPU. Implemented as a linked list, tree, or priority queue.
- Device (I/O) wait queues -> Each device has its own queue. Processes in **waiting** state reside here.

### CPU Scheduler

CPU scheduler chooses which ready process will be assigned the PCU next.

- Non-preemptive : Process keeps CPU until it releases it. Only switches on blocking or termination.
- Preemptive : Os forcibly takes CPU after a time quantum. Enables multitasking and interactive systems.

> Preemptive scheduling requires timer interrupts.

### Dispatcher (Context Switcher)

Dispatcher is the component that gives CPU control to the chosen process, performs context switch, jumps to process's next instruction.

Dispatcher latency (overhead) includes the time to : 

1. Save old process state
2. Load new process state
3. Switch mode.
4. Start running new process.

### Scheduling Criteria

- **CPU utilization** : Maximize CPU busy time.
- **Throughput** : Processes completed per time unit.
- **Turnaround time** : Time from submission to completion.
- **Waiting time** : Total time spent in ready queue.
- **Response time** : Time from submission to the first response.

### Extra Points

#### Scheduler != Dispatcher

> Scheduler makes decisions to select the next running process. Dispatcher executes that decision by doing context switching.

#### Multiprogramming != Multiprocessing

> Multiprogramming runs many processes on one CPU. Multiprocessing needs many CPU cores.
