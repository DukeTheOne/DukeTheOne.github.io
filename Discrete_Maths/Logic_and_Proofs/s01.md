## 1.1 - Propositional Logic

> Propositional logic is a branch of logic that studies how to combine simple statements into more complex ones.

### What is a Proposition?

A **proposition** is a declarative statement that is either true or false, but not both.

For example, ```2 + 3 = 100``` is a proposition, but ```x + 1 = 3``` is not. 

### Logic Connectives 

| Symbol | Name                       | Meaning                      |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ¬p     | negation                   | “not p”                      |
| p ∧ q  | conjunction                | “p and q”                    |
| p ∨ q  | disjunction (inclusive OR) | “p or q (or both)”           |
| p ⊕ q  | exclusive OR (XOR)         | “either p or q but not both” |
| p → q  | implication                | “if p then q”                |
| p ↔ q  | biconditional              | “p if and only if q”         |

### Truth Table

We can use truth table to compute the truth value of propositional statement.

For example, ```P → Q``` construct the table : 

| P | Q | P → Q |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T | 
| T | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | T |

### Language to Propositional Statement

For example, the English statement "If it rains, I bring an umbrella." can be translate into ```R → U```, 
where we let R being the proposition "It rains.", and U being the proposition "I bring an umbrella.".

### Inverse vs Converse vs Contrapositive

For an implication propositional statement ```P → Q```, we define it's..

- Inverse : ¬P → ¬Q
- Converse : Q → P
- Contrapositive : ¬Q → ¬P

> The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.

> And its inverse and its converse are also logically equivalent. 
> In fact they're the contrapositive of each other.
