## 1.2 - Applications of Propositional Logic

> This section focuses on how propositional logic is used in real systems.

### System Consistency

Systems are often constructed with multiple requirements. A system is **consistent** if they can all be true at the same time.

For example, "If user has permission, he can open the file.", "If user can open the file, the file is opened.", "File is not opened."

can be assigned with the propositional statements : 

- P : User has permission.
- Q : User can open the file.
- R : File is opened.

Thus the system becomes ```P → Q```, ```Q → R```, ```¬R```. 
And it is  consistent, since we can assign (P, Q, R) = (0, 0, 0) and three statement are true.

### Common English Phrases

| English                 | Logic  |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| “If P, then Q”          | p → q  |
| “P only if Q”           | p → q  |
| “P unless Q”            | ¬q → p |
| “P is necessary for Q”  | q → p  |
| “P is sufficient for Q” | p → q  |
